	<h1>Stress Diversion / by Megg </h1>
	<h2> What we do:</h2>
	<p>We offer a literary way to escape a hard day or even a difficult time. Sure as heck beats falling during the tree pose in yoga.</p>

	<p>There's so many things going on in our lives, and sometimes the stress can bring upon feelings of self-doubt or inadequacy which may lead to depression. It takes five seconds to share something motivating (and forever to get that damn kink out your neck)
	</p>


	<h2>Our mission:</h2>
    <p>to provide a forum for everyone to go to when they may be going through anything from job issues to a bad case of the blues.</p>
